##Introduction 
This plugin offers an Advanced AI management model with features like token-based task prioritization for NPCs, integration with an Advanced AIController using the CrowdFollowing component, and flexible multi-action support through the DoAction task within the Behavior Tree.

-In future updates, this system will be integrated with H3DPathfinding, which I developed in Unreal Engine.
